A starting point for creating applications. This repo combines awesome open-source libraries (Slim, Twig, Paris) with the Facebook PHP SDK to create Facebook applications and page tabs.

To install, simply clone and run Composer.

This repository is meant to simplify my personal workflow. As such, it is very much a work-in-progress and is sorely lacking in documentation. You are, of course, free and encouraged to fork it, try it, use it, love it, hate it, help me improve it, and so on!
